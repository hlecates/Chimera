NoSQL Summary:
Short for "Not Only SQL." Referring to non-relational databases, that store data in a non-tabular form, rather than a rule baased relational database. There are 5 types:

Document Databses:
    Used to store and query semi-structured data. Data is stored in JSON-like documents. easy to create and update applications without referencing a primary schema. 

Key-Value Databases:
    Simplest type. Data is stored in a key-value structure, where a unique key is paried with a value such as a string, number, boolean or complex object. Can use the key to retrieve or store its associated value. 

Column-oriented Databases:
    Store and read data in rows and organize in sets of columns. Column names and formatting in wide-column stores can vary from row to row. 

Graph Databases:
    Organize data as nodes in a graph, focusing on relationships between data elements. Connections between nodes are stored as first-class elements. 

In-Memory Databases:
    Store data in memory to provide ultra-low latency for real-time applications. 


ACID:
    Atomic --> All operations in a transaction succeed or the operation is rolled back
    Consistent --> On the completion of a transaction, the database is structurally sound
    Isolated --> Transactions do not contend with one another. Contentious access to data is moderated by the database so transactions appear sequentially
    Durable --> The results of applying a transaction are permanent, even in the presence of a failure.
